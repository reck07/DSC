# üíª DSC ‚Äì Data Structure Code Collection

Welcome to the **DSC (Data Structure Code)** repository!  
This project includes a curated set of simple and essential data structure programs, implemented for learning, practicing, and reference purposes.

üìÇ Project Structure

Each folder in this repository represents a self-contained program related to data structures or basic algorithmic concepts. Below are the currently included programs:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
| Program Name              | Description                                                     |
|---------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|
| `Single link list`        | Implementation of a singly linked list.                         |
| `infix to postfix`        | Conversion of infix expression to postfix notation using stack. |
| `linear search`           | Basic linear search algorithm.                                  |
| `loop program`            | Simple loop-based program using `for`/`while`.                  |
